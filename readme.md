To deliver a **Spring Boot Microservice** which will provide the user with a comprehensive Kanban Board to run in the cloud or in a WebServer.


**This delivers a True "Scrum Kanban Board" for the agile team with the following features:**

  * A unique feature is the ability to Create Epics. (which many of the so called Kanban boards don't offer)
  * Another feature is the ability to Split Tasks into Subtasts. 
  * This application displays two Kanban boards One at the Task level the other at the Subtask level.
  * This features the Spring Security Framework with A database for Authentication and Authorization.
  

**Your Work flow is as follows:**  

 1. You Create Customers.
 2. Then create Epics each with its customer assigned to it.
 3. Create and assign Userstories to the Epics.
 4. Create and assign Tasks to the Userstories.
